st.write("""
Connect 4 is a classic and tactical board game for two players.  
The goal is to get four of your own pieces in a row – either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally – before your opponent does.

#### Game Structure
The game is played on a vertical board with 6 rows and 7 columns.  
Players take turns dropping one colored disc (usually red or yellow) into any chosen column.  
The disc automatically falls to the lowest available space in that column.

#### Tactics and Strategy
It takes both strategic thinking and tactical awareness to get four in a row.  
Players must focus on building their own winning line while also blocking their opponent’s attempts to do the same.

#### Why is Connect 4 so popular?
Connect 4 is easy to learn but offers depth and challenge that make it exciting for both children and adults.  
The game strengthens logical thinking, planning, and tactical understanding, which is why it has remained a beloved classic for generations.
